    <div class="txtcolor"><b>This website is made only with HTML and CSS. Basically I didnt learn from any paid course or anything, It was all
        by my own, well ofcourse took some help from free online platforms where there are numerous Videos and sites
        which can easily provide you with some basic knowledge and will certainly help you out learing a bit and
        ofcourse you need to work on your own to gather a pile of information. Since this is the very first website of
        mine so the code might seem a liltle bloated to you but working on it continuously and trying to make it better
        than this.</b></div>
